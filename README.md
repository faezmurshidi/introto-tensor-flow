Intro to googleâ€™s tensorFlow

This is a sample SIMPLE intro to machine learning and Google's tensor flow.

In this sample, we will be dealing with a dataset from Dept. of Forest Sciences, Colorado State University.
we are required to predict the forest cover type (the predominant kind of tree cover) from strictly cartographic variables
(as opposed to remotely sensed data). The actual forest cover type for a given observation (30 x 30 meter cell) was
determined from US Forest Service (USFS) Region 2 Resource Information System (RIS) data.

You can obtain the data here or from this link: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Covertype
